<h3>Vegetable Soup</h3>
<img src="../img/vegetablesoup.jpg" alt="Vegetable Soup">
<p>Vegetable soup is paired with any of the swallows in Nigeria and served as either lunch or dinner. This recipe shows you how to cook a healthy soup with vegetables (ugu and water leaves) the Nigerian way.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, we combine different vegetables to make different soups.
    Okra soup, Afang soup and even edikaikong are different combinations of different veggies.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Big bowl Waterleaves</li>
 <li>Big bowl ugu leaves (fluted pumpkin)</li>
 <li>Roasted mackerel</li>
 <li>1KG or 35 Ounces of Goat meat</li>
 <li>1 cup crayfish</li>
 <li>6 scotch bonnet peppers</li>
 <li>400ml Palm oil</li>
 <li>2 seasoning cubes</li>
 <li>Salt to taste</li>
 <li>2 tablespoons Ground Ofor</li>   
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>Slice the water leaves and fluted pumpkin leaves with a kitchen knife, you want them thinly sliced as you can see below.
    <p>What you find below is a bowl of fluted pumpkin leaves – vegetables.
        This is the equivalent of 12 cups. You should wash ugu (fluted pumpkin) properly before slicing them.</p>

</li>
<li>Wash the roasted fish, remove center bone and break to smaller bits.</li>
<li>To the boiling meat, add the washed, roasted fish. Allow them to cook until the water dries. Don’t allow it to burn.
    <p>Most people don’t like too much water in their vegetable soup, to achieve that, use some tricks – like boiling the meat/fish till the water is almost dried.

    </p>
</li>
<li>When the meat cooked and the water is almost completely dried, add the palm oil, 400ml. You need lots of palm oil when you cook vegetable soup.

</li>
<li>Now you add the vegetables, the water leaves should come first. It should fill the pot, it will go down in 3 minutes as you continue to stir.</li>
<li>Add the pounded crayfish and peppers.Stir all together and taste for salt, add salt to your taste. You don’t want too much salt.</li>
<li>Add the ugu leaves (fluted pumpkin) at this point.

    Stir in 2 tablespoons of ofor (used as a thickener). Turn properly so it doesn’t form crumbs.Stir all together and allow the vegetable soup to simmer for three minutes.

    That is how to make vegetable soup the Nigerian way.</li>
